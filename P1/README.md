# PART 01

## Installation:
  1. Setup a VM with [Ubuntu 22.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/).
  2. Install [Docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04).
  3. Install [GNS3](https://docs.gns3.com/docs/getting-started/installation/linux/).

## Insights:
- ### Docker:
  - An open source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update and manage containersâ€”standardized, executable components that combine application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment ([see more](https://www.ibm.com/topics/docker)).
- ### GNS3:
  - GNS3 is open source, free software that is used by hundreds of thousands of network engineers worldwide to emulate, configure, test and troubleshoot virtual and real networks. GNS3 allows you to run a small topology consisting of only a few devices on your laptop, to those that have many devices hosted on multiple servers or even hosted in the cloud([see more](https://docs.gns3.com/docs/)).

- ### Dynamic Routing Protocols:
  - OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) designed expressly for IP networks, supporting IP subnetting
  and tagging of externally derived routing information. OSPF also allows packet authentication and uses IP
  multicast when sending and receiving packets ([see more](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst9400/software/release/16-12/configuration_guide/rtng/b_1612_rtng_9400_cg/configuring_ospf.pdf)).
  - BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the postal service of the Internet. When someone drops a letter into a mailbox, the Postal Service processes that piece of mail and chooses a fast, efficient route to deliver that letter to its recipient. Similarly, when someone submits data via the Internet, BGP is responsible for looking at all of the available paths that data could travel and picking the best route, which usually means hopping between autonomous systems([see more](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/)).
  - IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) is an IGP, link-state routing protocol, similar to OSPF. It forms neighbor adjacencies, has areas, exchanges link-state packets, builds a link-state database and runs the Dijkstra SPF algorithm to find the best path to each destination, which is installed in the routing table([see more](https://networklessons.com/cisco/ccie-routing-switching-written/introduction-to-is-is)).
